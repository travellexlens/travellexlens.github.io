	<p>Hi I'm Alexis. I am an aspring Travel Blogger that wants to showcase to the world how much you can learn and grow from just living in a foreign place for a small amount of time. What MOST people don't realize is that everyone has the ability to travel! As long as you set a budget and understand the intention and main goal of your trip, you can go pretty much ANYWHERE. Take a look at my most recent post to read more about taking your first solo trip across the world!</p>
